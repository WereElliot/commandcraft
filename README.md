# CommandCraft: Everyday Utility Hub Powered by Github Copilot CLI

## Problem Statement
In the fast-paced world of software development, efficiency is key. Developers often find themselves wrestling with complex shell commands, trying to remember the right syntax for tasks like file manipulation, system monitoring, or version control. This reliance on memory or constant searching for command-line snippets slows down workflows and introduces unnecessary friction into the development process.

## Solution Overview
CommandCraft is a terminal-based assistant that transforms natural language into working commands and scripts. Powered by the GitHub Copilot CLI, it acts as an intelligent layer between the user and their shell, allowing them to express their intent in plain English and receive the correct command instantly. This not only streamlines daily tasks but also serves as a learning tool for those less familiar with the command line.

## Feature List
- **Natural Language to Command:** Convert plain English into executable shell commands.
- **File Organization:** Automatically sort files in your `~/Downloads` folder by type (e.g., PDFs, images, archives).
- **System Insights:** Quickly display disk usage in a human-readable format.
- **Backup Utility:** Create compressed backups of project folders with a simple command.
- **Git Shortcuts:** Simplify common Git operations, such as undoing the last commit while keeping changes or viewing commit history.
- **Extensibility:** Easily add your own custom natural language shortcuts for personalized workflows.

## Demo Instructions
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WereElliot/commandcraft.git
    cd commandcraft
    ```
2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python commandcraft.py
    ```
3.  **Try some of the following commands:**
    - "Organize my downloads by file type"
    - "Show me disk usage"
    - "Backup my project folder 'my-project' to 'backups'"
    - "Undo my last git commit"
    - "Show me my git history"

## Impact and Benefits
- **Accelerated Workflow:** Spend less time recalling command syntax and more time on what matters: building software.
- **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Offload the mental burden of remembering complex commands to an intelligent assistant.
- **Improved Accessibility:** Make the command line more approachable for beginners and non-experts.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** Automate repetitive tasks and streamline your development process.
- **Learn by Doing:** Discover new commands and shell features by seeing the output of your natural language queries.
